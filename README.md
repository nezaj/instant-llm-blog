## Instant LLM Blog

Making a little blogging platform with Instant using Claude. Idea here is to try
to build this entirely with Claude and see how far we can get.

I used [repomix](https://repomix.com/) to concatenate the docs and client code
into `context.xml` and I record my experience `notes.md`
